# Does-Name-Contain-Chem-Symbol

Inspired by AMC's Breaking Bad:

This is a program which determines how many different chemical symbols are contained within a name.

A name should be passed as input when running the program.

Have fun testing names!

If someone out there that knows chemistry could add a feature where a chemical compound featuring all the chemical symbols is output, that would be great.
